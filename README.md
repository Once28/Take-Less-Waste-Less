**Project Description**

Our users will be mainly students and teachers, but those groups such as parents and community members can access the information as well. As our site will not be collecting any private or identifying information, our website will have full public-facing data so that any user will be able to access the food waste information.

The information that our users will be viewing is food waste data for participating schools across the country, including how much food is wasted each week per capita per school as well as averages for schools and districts over time. Additionally, we will display the best performing schools in each district and in the nation.

Some forms of interaction include:

* A navigation bar that allows users to click on the following pages:
    * Home
    * The food waste tracker page allowing users to select a specific school they want to see and the rankings of all the schools in the district based on the percentage of reduction of the week
    * Feedback
    * Login/Signup Page
* Another main form of interaction is the page where a faculty member inputs the amount of pounds of food that was wasted for the past week
* Lastly, there is a button allowing users to visualize the percentage of food waste reduction of any school

Our app will help to solve the issue of food waste in grade school cafeterias by making our users aware of the magnitude of the issue. This is accomplished by visualizing their own waste for them. Additionally, we will provide daily tips for the students and schools about how to take less and waste less.
